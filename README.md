# Abstract
This paper analyzes the relationship between Continuous Time Fourier Transform (CTFT), Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT), Fourier Series (FS), and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). With the introduction of the continuous form of a discrete-time signal, it is possible to uniformly express CTFT, DTFT, FS, and DFT in terms of CTFT. DTFT is CTFT adapted for discrete-time signals, FS is CTFT adapted for periodic continuous-time signals, and DFT is CTFT adapted for periodic discrete-time signals. CTFT, DTFT, FS, and DFT can be tied together by the properties of Dirac delta combs (or impulse trains) and the Poisson's summation formula. Discreteness and periodicity plays a critical roles in the transformation between CTFT, DTFT, FS, and DFT. It turns out that discreteness in the time domain translates to periodicity in the frequency domain, whereas periodicity in the time domain translates to discreteness in the frequency domain. This paper also discusses the conventions of Fourier transforms because it will be hard to unify CTFT, DTFT, FS, and DFT unless the same convention is used for all of them. This paper concludes with a brief discussion of the meaning of DFT in signal processing.
